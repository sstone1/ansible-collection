==================================================================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Create, update, or delete a connection profile for a Hyperledger Fabric network by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (optional, str, None)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_authtype (optional, str, None)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.


  api_key (optional, str, None)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_secret (optional, str, None)
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.


  api_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_token_endpoint (optional, str, https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token)
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.


  state (optional, str, present)
    ``absent`` - If a connection profile exists at the specified path, it will be removed.

    ``present`` - Asserts that a connection profile exists at the specified path. If no connection profile exists, a connection profile will be created. If a connection profile exists, but does not match the specfied configuration, then the connection profile will be updated, if it can be. If it cannot be updated, it will be removed and re-created with the specified configuration.


  name (optional, str, None)
    The name of this connection profile.


  path (optional, any, None)
    The path to the JSON file where the connection profile will be stored.


  organization (optional, any, None)
    The organization for this connection profile.


  certificate_authority (optional, list, None)
    The certificate authority to reference in this connection profile.

    You can pass a string, which is the display names of a certificate authority registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dictionary, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`certificate_authority_info <certificate_authority_info_module>` or :ref:`certificate_authority <certificate_authority_module>` modules.


  peers (optional, list, None)
    The peers to reference in this connection profile.

    You can pass strings, which are the display names of peers registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass dictionaries, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`peer_info <peer_info_module>` or :ref:`peer <peer_module>` modules.
